# murlisp
a lisp interpreter written in C
This is done as a code along project with the Build Your own Lisp book. 

I had some issues with the way the project is structured i might fix that later.
I got some practice in C and learned how a lisp interpreter works.
also learned some lisp along the way. 

# TODO
## I might add a documentation on how to use the language implemented here later
